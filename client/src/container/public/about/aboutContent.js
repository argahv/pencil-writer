Life is not programmed to run in a linear way. You must be in your laptop or phone, reading this one, while others are writing their own. People love to hear about your life.<i><strong> You must have travelled to some great places, wrote some music about your life, wrote some poems based on something that has caught you eye.</strong></i> <strong>Why not share it? Why not let others know that you have a great writing skills? Why not do it now?</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:right;"><span class="text-big">This site is for those people who want to share their life story, their ups-and-downs, their happy moments.</span></p><p><span class="text-big">Yeah, people love to share it, do it.

You can get paid for every genuine story you write about.</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="text-huge" style="color:hsl(0, 75%, 60%);"><i><strong>For the first content you write, you get 30 points* , For every “Fires”, you get 10 points*.
